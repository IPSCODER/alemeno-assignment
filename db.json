Besides being critical for interviews, knowledge of the Event Loop will give you a better understanding of how Node works internally.  Many engineers know not to 'block' the Event Loop, but they don't necessarily understand why.  You will be one of the engineers who can clearly articulate the performance profile of Node and its Event Loop.",
